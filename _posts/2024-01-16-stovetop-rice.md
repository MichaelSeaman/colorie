# Ingredients
- [ ] 1 cup of rice (long-grain or medium-grain, like basmati or jasmine; short-grain, like sushi rice; or brown rice)

# Recipe
1. **Rinse the Rice**  
   Place rice in a bowl. Fill with cold water, swirl with your fingers, then drain the starchy water. Repeat until the water runs mostly clear.

2. **Add Water & Cook**  
   Combine rice and water in a pot using the following ratio based on the rice type:

   - **Long/Medium-grain:** 1 cup rice to 1 1/3 cups water  
   - **Short-grain:** 1 cup rice to 1 cup water  
   - **Brown rice:** 1 cup rice to 1 3/4 cups water  

   Water level should sit about 1/2 inch above the rice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

3. **Simmer**  
   Once boiling, stir to prevent sticking. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for:

   - **Long/Medium-grain:** 15 minutes  
   - **Short-grain:** 20 minutes  
   - **Brown rice:** 30 minutes  

4. **Steam Off Heat**  
   Listen for the sound to change from bubbling to a flutter. Remove from heat, place a towel under the lid, and let it sit for 10–15 minutes.

5. **Serve**  
   Fluff with a fork and serve as a side or base for your meal.
